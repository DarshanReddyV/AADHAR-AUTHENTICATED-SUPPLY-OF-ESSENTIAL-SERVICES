# AADHAR-AUTHENTICATED-SUPPLY-OF-ESSENTIAL-SERVICES
The app will be build and urged to the people to use the app by using help of central and state government. The people have to register themselves by authenticating with AADHAR number so that each person from a family will be registered. Once the registration is done a unique id will be given, with this the person can log in and order the essential commodities through the app, once the order is placed the vendor will be notified and he/she will prepare the baggage of the ordered commodities and provides the time for picking his/her essential commodities. Once this will be given the person will be notified through message or though the mail so he/she can go to the store and pick the bag and go back to their home. After the dispatch the id will be blocked for the next three days, after three days the person can reorder and the cycle continues.
